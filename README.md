$ yarn db                         # Restart docker container with mongodb and add seed data (npm run db)
$ yarn db:stop                    # Stop docker container with mongodb (npm run db:stop)
$ yarn start:dev                  # Run app locally in watch mode (npm run start:dev)
$ yarn start                      # Run app through docker just like the test environment (npm start)
$ yarn stop                       # Stop and clean app that was running through docker (npm stop)
