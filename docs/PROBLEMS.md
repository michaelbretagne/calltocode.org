## <a name="database"></a> Database Troubleshooting

The MongoDB is ran in a docker container. You will need to have ports 27017 and 28017 open. See the [address/port already in use](#addressinuse) section to see how to open these. After the database is created, seed data is automatically imported so that testing can be done.

General troubleshooting steps:

- Ensure [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#supported-platforms) is installed: `docker --version`

- Ensure direnv is set up properly with `direnv allow`. See the [development environment setup](DEVELOPER.md) if you have not done so already. If nothing else works, at the very least, run `source .env`.

- Start and seed the MongoDB database: `yarn db`

- Make sure the database is running by running `yarn start:dev` (should see 'Database Connected' in your terminal)

- Make sure database is seeded by either checking the data in Robo 3T if you downloaded that (see [development environment setup](DEVELOPER.md)) or by trying to log in with Kevin's credentials (check them in the `Personas` story in the Icebox on Pivotal Tracker)

## <a name="addressinuse"></a> Address/port already in use

**Problem**: `Error: address already in use`

**Solution**: `lsof -ti tcp:3000,27017,28017 | xargs kill -9 --no-run-if-empty`

## <a name="containernotrunning"></a> Error response from daemon: Container <id> is not running

**Problem**:
```bash
$ yarn db start
Starting new docker container with MongoDB..
Started container 38ee6b4af0c4481a137209c70bb64784afbd33f4ab5bbb37735aa9d2ca945bf7

Error response from daemon: Container 38ee6b4af0c4481a137209c70bb64784afbd33f4ab5bbb37735aa9d2ca945bf7 is not running
error Command failed with exit code 1.
```

**Solution**:
```bash
$ yarn db stop
$ docker system prune
$ docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -qf dangling=true)
```

## <a name="errors"></a> Errors

**Problem (1)**: I pulled the latest changes from master and I am now getting an error.

**Problem (2)**: I installed a new dependency with `npm install` and I am now getting an error.

**Problem (3)**:
```bash
$ yarn start:dev
yarn run v1.3.2
$ NODE_ENV=dev npm-run-all --parallel client:watch server:watch
/bin/sh: npm-run-all: command not found
error Command failed with exit code 127.
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command.
```

**Solution**: `yarn`

---

**Problem**: I am not seeing anything once I view the app at `localhost:3000`.

**Solution**: `yarn db`

## <a name="tests"></a> Test Errors

General information about testing can be found in the [test docs](./TESTS.md).

**Problem**: I tried to run the end-to-end (e2e) tests and they failed.

**Solution**: Make sure the app is freshly running with `yarn restart` before you run the e2e tests in another terminal. If this isn't the issue, then it is possible you have introduced breaking changes that are causing them to fail.
