## <a name="database"></a> Database Troubleshooting

The MongoDB is ran in a docker container. You will need to have ports 27017 and 28017 open. See the [address/port already in use](#addressinuse) section to see how to open these. After the database is created, seed data is automatically imported so that testing can be done.

General troubleshooting steps:

- Ensure [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/#supported-platforms) is installed: `docker --version`

- Ensure direnv is set up properly with `direnv allow`. See the [development environment setup](DEVELOPER.md) if you have not done so already. If nothing else works, at the very least, run `source .env`.

- Make sure the database is running by running `yarn restart` (should see 'Database Connected' in your terminal)

- Make sure database is seeded by either checking the data in Robo 3T if you downloaded that (see [development environment setup](DEVELOPER.md)) or by trying to log in with Kevin's credentials (check them in the `Personas` story in the Icebox on Pivotal Tracker)

**Problem**:

```
Database connection error { MongoNetworkError: failed to connect to server [127.0.0.1:27017] on first connect [MongoNetworkError: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:27017]
```

**Solution**: Try [here](#addressinuse), followed by `yarn restart`

## <a name="addressinuse"></a> Address/port already in use

**Problem**: `Error: address already in use`

**Solution**: Free all needed ports with `lsof -ti tcp:3000,3001,27017,28017 | xargs kill -9 --no-run-if-empty`

## <a name="containernotrunning"></a> Error response from daemon: Container <id> is not running

```bash

**Solution**:
```bash

## <a name="errors"></a> Errors

**Problem (1)**: I pulled the latest changes from master and I am now getting an error.

**Problem (2)**: I installed a new dependency with `npm install` and I am now getting an error.

**Problem (3)**:
```bash

**Solution**: `yarn`

**Problem**: I am not seeing anything once I view the app at `localhost:3000`.

**Solution**: `yarn restart`

## <a name="tests"></a> Test Errors

General information about testing can be found in the [test docs](./TESTS.md).
